        <p>Now looking at both sides we can determine that the government is in need and in favor of the surveillance acts. Therefore, it would be extrinsic to be talking about a solution canceling the surveillance program. It would be smarter to put Privacy Safeguards on the programs, as it is already being done with lawmakers to enforce new safety policies. Although, the lawmakers were not successful in the fact the the new policies were not passed. However, the ideal solution would be for the government to accept new the private policies and revert some parts of the surveillance programs to the traditional surveillance methods, such as bugging rooms.
