        <h1 id="info_h1">The History of Domestic and Foreign Surveillance</h1>
        <p>The NSA was established in July 1917 during the first World War, when the man named Herbert O. Yardley took the head position of the Cipher Bureau of Military Intelligence. The intelligence was used during WWI, WWII, the Cold War, and up to our current day to prevent terrorists from attacking, which is where most of our conflict comes from. After the era of traditional surveillance using techniques such as bugging or spying, the NSA and other security agencies started to use Mass Surveillance. This was possible as such a large population of the world had technology. More and more of the population find out about the measures the government take to keep use safe. There was the greatest controversy after Edward Snowden released top secret NSA files regarding the extent of the U.S. surveillance program. Many found the surveillance program to be invasive and other believed in security and safety more. For many years, the scale of importance between privacy and security is still in debate.</p>
