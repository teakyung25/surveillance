          <h2>Argument One</h2>
          <h4>The NSA should not have the right to check internet activity, email, telephone records, and so on because privacy is more important than safety.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>More than 534 million records of phone calls and text messages where collected by the NSA’s mass surveillance program.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="quote_one">
            "More than 534 million records of phone calls and text messages where collected by the NSA’s mass surveillance program."
            <br><br>

          </div>
          <h2>Argument Two</h2>
          <h4>The NSA should require a warrant to read private information, this is unconstitutional as it breaks the 4th amendment.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Many anti-surveillance protesters believe that the surveillance breaks the fourth amendment.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="quote_one">
            “The facts show that mass surveillance does not work. Traditional surveillance methods that existed long before 9/11 succeed over 70 percent of the time. This success rate occurred despite significant intelligence community resources being diverted to pay the roughly $100M annual operating cost of PRISM”
            <br><br>
            -University of Tennessee
          </div>
          <h2>Argument Three</h2>
          <h4>The NSA should not have access to resources that can aid them in tracking all foreign communications because it is connected to an citizen of the United States. Data found in the foreign surveillance program can affect citizens with information found although the purpose of the program is to detect foreign threats. The F.I.S.A(Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) applies to around 100,000 countries around the world.  This is unconstitutional and attacks the privacy rights of many American citizens and foreign member that partakes in such communications.</h4>
          <div class="quote_one">
            “Information about Americans that is gathered by the program can be used for criminal investigations unrelated to terrorism.”

        <div id="right_arguments">
          <h2>Argument One</h2>
          <h4>The NSA and other government agencies need the information to make sure people in this country are safe. The information can provide crucial information about a crime that has the potential to hurt or put many citizens in danger.</h4>
          <div class="quote_one">
            “Terror attacks cannot be stopped without extensive information”
            <br><br>
            -Tayler Houston
          </div>
          <h2>Argument Two</h2>
          <h4>Mass surveillance is the only way government agencies like the NSA to find useful data that can potentially help with finding terrorists and other crimes.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Mass Surveillance is the only tool that gives the NSA a clue of what is going on internationally and domestically crime wise.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Argument Three</h2>
          <h4>The government must be able to track foreign communication to widen the search field of crime and terrorist around the world, this is important and is higher up in the scale of priority than the privacy of the citizens.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Section 702 of FISA was renewed in 2017 with the vote  256 to 164.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="quote_one">
            “it is unnecessary, and dangerous, to limit security officials from being able to freely gain access to information the government already possessed.”
