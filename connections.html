        <h1 id="info_h1">Connections to the Civil Rights Movement</h1>
        <p>The surveillance movement like most other movement like the Civil Rights movement have some similarities. To begin, it is important to implement civil right leaders as people look up to them and follow them, they are an inspiration. Without a leader and inspiration for others to act out, it was seen in the past in court cases like Plessy v. Ferguson, that it will not end fair and the Surveillance movement also have figures that are there to inspire. For example, Congressman Justin Amash, Former senior NSA executive and whistleblower Thomas Drake, and more that are here to stop a wrong. Also, it is important to have Civil rights leaders that can have an impact, like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr, and more. The anti-surveillance group, STOP WATCHING US, have leaders that are qualified, for example, former senior NSA executive and whistleblower Thomas Drake is out there inspiring people. Finally, it is important for the protesters to find the right environment to do it, a place that shows the most impact to the cause you are protesting for. In the past, groups like the Freedom writers and Lunch sit ins, would protest peacefully right in front of the other side of the protest, we can see this will the surveillance protesters too, as they protest in places like the U.S. states capital.</p>
